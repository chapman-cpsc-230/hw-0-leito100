**Author:** _Paloma Leiton_

**Due date:** _\2/4/16\_

## Description

_For this assignment one must clone the repository to the local machine, then edit the README.md file. Once the file is edited perform a commit and then push the file back to the github repository. _

## What I Learned from This

_ I learned how to clone a repository to my local files and how to push it back up to the github server once it is edited._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_Paloma Leiton_
